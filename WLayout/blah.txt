- Dispatch system that works with W's events and the prospective WView system
- Uses WCallbacks, or llambdas?
	- The same problem exists with llambdas, i.e. how to use multiple 



Layout system
- based on Diatoms
- a list of elements and a flow of information representing the layout
- an item in the information flow consists of:
	 source -> rule -> destination

	 	- source:      an element or set of elements
		- rule:        a property/set of properties of the element(s)
		               and a transformation
		- destination: another element

- they form a network that's processed in order
- every view in the resulitng layout should end up with the necessary positioning information:
		- x, y, w, h

layout:
	intrinsics:
		A:
			w: 20
			h: 40
		B:
			x: 0
			y: 0

	rules:
		A:
			x: B.x + 10
			y: B.y + 10
		B:
			w: container.w
			h: container.h / 2


Problem: account for runtime changes (image/text sizes, user moving things around, animations, etc)
- What we DON'T want to do: increase the scope of the project to image loading, text layout, etc.
- Instead, the run time should allow for modifying intrinsics
